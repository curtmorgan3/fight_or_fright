Description

The user plays a hero on Halloween that must travel through the infinite levels of a haunted house. He
is armed with a wooden sword and his wit. Each level of the house is populated with monsters for the hero
to slay. As the hero slays more and more monsters, he gets stronger, faster and smarter. As the hero levels
up, so too do the monsters he must destroy.

The child will have stats that determine certain actions:
  Strength will make his attacks deal more damage
  Speed will make him harder for monsters to hit and more likely to go first
  Dexterity will make it easier to hit monsters
  Fortitude will make him harder to kill
  Luck will help him collect better loot

The monsters will have their own stats of all the above minus luck (monsters aren't lucky)

At the start of each floor, the turn order is established randomly, favoring speed. Each monster, plus
the hero, will have a turn.

During each turn the hero may either:
  Attack - choose one monster to attack
  Use Item - use items he's found in the haunted house
  Escape - try to run away, but be careful! Each monster will attack on the way out

If the hero slays all monsters on a floor, he receives experience points will will help him level up.
Each time the hero levels up, he chooses one stat to make better by one point. The hero's health is
restored and he continues to the next floor.
